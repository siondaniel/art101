					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, learn to use anonymous functions
						and callbacks.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When we completed all of our JavaScript code, 
						nothing appeared on the page. After reading the instructions further,
						we realized we would need to use the console to see the results of our code.
						As an alternative, we decided to add a div to the page that would display the
						results of our code with id "output" as per Task X.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We worked hard on this lab and learned a lot about anonymous functions and callbacks.
						We put extra effort into making our code as clean and readable as possible. We also 
						put in time to complete Task X in order to make the results of our code more visible.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						Given the template code, creating this lab was straightforward and I did not encounter any problems.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Write down summary of efforts here: 
						I worked on this lab alone as I was unable to find time to partner up. I began by copying my html template and modifying certain fields.
						From there, I created a function that would use AJAX to retrieve data from the PokemonAPI. I then used jQuery to display the data in a table.
						Finally, I added a button that would activate the function when clicked. I list the first 5 Pokemon in the table including their name, height, and weight.
						For displaying purposes, I used JSON.stringify to display the data in a readable format. Overall, I feel this lab was a great learning experience, and something I could potentially use in my final project.

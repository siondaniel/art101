					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Write down summary of efforts here: 
						I began by copying my previous lab folder over and modifying all the names from lab 11 to 12.
						From there I followed the directions for the form, input, submit button, and output div.
						The given instructions were very clear and straightforward, allowing me to go through without
						any problems. Once my index.html was complete, I went on to my lab.js file. The function for this 
						lab was very simple as it was just an if with a few elif statements (which translated from other languages
						that I have worked with before). Beyond this, I used jQuery to get the value of the input, sort it,
						and then output it to the div. I feel using jQuery showed my understanding of the material and
						allowed me to complete the lab in a more efficient manner, going above and beyond the requirements.
					</p>

			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure
						on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did not run into any challenges on this lab as the file structure
						was given to me from the github repo I cloned from the installfest
						instructions.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was a lot of fun to make.
						I put a lot of effort into making the navigation bar at the bottom look 
						clean using CSS, including adding coments to the CSS file to explain
						what each line does. I also resized my images in the HTML file to
						make sure they are clearly visible/ readable on the page.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the index.html page I created, you can see the interactive,
						intuitive navigation bar at the bottom of the page. Along with this lab
						is the homepage index.html page.
					</p>
					<p>Here is a visual showing the overall structure:</p>
					<div id="output">

					<p>Here is a visual showing the index.html source code:</p>

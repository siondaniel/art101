			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to devise pseudocode to solve a problem.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The major problem we had when doing this assignment was thinking of pseudo code for recreating Hangman. 
						We knew how to play the game on paper and had a general idea of how we could code it, 
						but abstracting our ideas into English was somewhat difficult. It is easy to understand what we want to do, 
						but in creating pseudocode/ comments, you want to create something that is easy to understand and recreate by others. 
						We decided to consult ChatGPT to aid us in making our game easy to understand.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Despite the pseudocode for creating a computer game being somewhat of an issue, 
						this lab was pretty straightforward for the most part. The tasks were pretty simple to understand and do.</p>

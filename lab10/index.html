					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, write a html form that uses an event listener in JavaScript.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> During this Lab, my partner and I had difficulty finding a good time to work on the lab.
						We also ran into some issues with the event listener refreshing the page once the button was clicked.
						We were able to fix this by adding a preventDefault() function to the event listener. We also had trouble
						with the output not showing up but fixed this by making sure our docucument.getElementById() was correct.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Write down summary of efforts here: 
						During this lab, my partner and I worked together to create a form that would take in a user's name and
						display it on the page (in sorted alphabetical order). We were able to do this by creating a form with a 
						text input and a button. We then created an event listener for the button that would take in the user's name
						and display it on the page. We also used a function that would sort the names in alphabetical order (taken from
						lab 7).
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<form>
						<label for="user-name">Input your name: </label>
						<input type="text" id="user-name" name="user-name" />
						<button id="my-button">Click Me!</button>
					</form>
					<h2>Script Output</h2>

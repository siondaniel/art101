					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Although our group didn't run into many problems during the lab, we did encounter one minor challenge. 
						Specifically, we had to ensure that our JavaScript code was error-free. 
						Unfortunately, we discovered that a missing semicolon in one of our lines of code was causing our code 
						to malfunction on the website. 
						After identifying the issue, we added the missing semicolon and were able to successfully run our code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>	We spent a good amount of time and effort on Lab 5. The first step in the Lab we completed with ease. 
						It asked use to define and use some variables in a JavaScript console in our browser. 
						We simply followed the same concepts we learned in class. 
						Task 2 we ran into some trouble with a missing semicolon that we were eventually able to spot and correct. 
						Task 3 we put in extra effort into finding a png photo rather than a regular jpeg to make the car really 
						blend into our site. We put additional effort into this lab by linking all the other labs at the bottom, 
						as well as adding in the link to Lab 5 to the index.html files in previous labs.

				<h1>Hello World</h1>
				<p>My Name is <span id="name">Sion</span>! (Pronounced Shawn) I am a 4th year Computer Science Major at UCSC.
					I am from Massachusetts and love cats, to read, and play soccer.</p>
					<p>I have been programming since I was 15 years old, 
					but have not had any experience with Javascript.</p>
					<p>The most advanced web development project I've made was in CSE 115A Intro to Software Engineering, 
					where my group created a web application with stock trading functionality.</p>
					<p>Some fun facts about me are that I am not very creative, can program Haskell, am a fan of the Flatbush Zombies, 
					and have a job in Quant Trading after graduation.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>In this lab, I had to brush up on my HTML and CSS skills. I had to remember how to use the different tags and
					how to style them. It wasn't too challenging, so I didn't have any problems.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I put a lot of energy into this assignment, as I wanted to make sure I did well on it. More importantly,
						I wanted to make sure I understood the material and made a visually appealing webpage. I also had fun playing 
						around with features</p>

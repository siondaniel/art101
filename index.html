					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My Name is <span id="name">Sion</span>! (Pronounced Shawn) I am a 4th year Computer Science Major at UCSC.
					I am from Massachusetts and love cats, to read, and play soccer.</p>
					<p>I have been programming since I was 15 years old, 
					but have not had any experience with Javascript.</p>
					<p>The most advanced web development project I've made was in CSE 115A Intro to Software Engineering, 
					where my group created a web application with stock trading functionality.</p>
					<p>Some fun facts about me are that I am not very creative, can program Haskell, am a fan of the Flatbush Zombies, 
					and have a job in Quant Trading after graduation.</p>
